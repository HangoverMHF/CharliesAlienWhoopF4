## DIY Flight Controller :alien:
Order your own PCBs from OSH Park by visiting the link below. I recommend ordering the 2oz copper 0.8mm thickness PCB. It takes about three weeks but that will allow plenty of time to order components from the bill of materials in the resources folder. I don't receive any commission or compesation when you order from OSH Park--simply created as a convenience to you.

~ Please note: AlienWhoop is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Lance (alienflight.com) or any other Alien projects. The use of Alien in the name and the alien head vector graphic used on the board silkscreen are nods to the lineage of this remix and to the work of Lance and others who created the conditions for this project to arise. Likewise, AlienWhoop is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Tiny Whoop. The Whoop in the name comes from Jesse Perkin's fantastic Tiny Whoop ("a small first-person-view aircraft that truly allows you to feel the gift of flight and the feeling of being tiny" [tinywhoop.com]) and is simply a nod to his efforts and the TW community worldwide.
